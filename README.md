# 📊 HEDIS Quality Metric Dashboard

This project demonstrates how to extract, analyze, and visualize healthcare quality metrics using simulated Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, focusing on the HEDIS measures.

## 🔍 Overview

The HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set) dashboard provides a data-driven view of key population health metrics. Using mock data, this project covers:

- Patient visit data ingestion
- HEDIS metric calculations (e.g., HbA1c, immunizations, cancer screenings)
- SQL data wrangling
- Python dashboard to visualize and report metrics

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `data/`: Simulated patient and visit data (CSV format)
- `sql/`: SQL scripts to extract HEDIS-related measures
- `notebooks/`: Data analysis in Jupyter notebook
- `dashboard/`: Streamlit dashboard code
- `docs/`: PDF documentation explaining HEDIS metrics
- `reports/`: Example output report (PDF)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- SQL
- Python (Pandas, Streamlit)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Simulated EHR data
- Data visualization

## ✅ HEDIS Metrics Covered

- HbA1c Testing
- Childhood Immunization Status
- Cervical Cancer Screening
- Colorectal Cancer Screening
